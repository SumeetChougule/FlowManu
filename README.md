# Flow Manufacturing Project

## Multi-stage continuous-flow manufacturing process

This project involves predicting certain properties of a high-speed, continuous manufacturing process with parallel and series stages. The real process data was collected from an actual production line near Detroit, Michigan.

## Overview

The dataset used in this project is from a Kaggle project and aims to predict factory output based on various input data. The manufacturing process consists of multiple stages, and the goal is to build models that can effectively predict specific properties of the production line's output.

## Data Source

The data was collected from an actual production line near Detroit, Michigan. For more details and to access the dataset, refer to the [Kaggle project](#https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/supergus/multistage-continuousflow-manufacturing-process).
